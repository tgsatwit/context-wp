The Context-First Organisation: Why AI Demands We Rethink How We Work

## Executive Summary

"Too many meetings. Too many emails." This is the common complaint of our workforce.

We have a context flow problem. Critical knowledge is currently trapped in people’s heads and accessible only through synchronous coordination. If left unsolved, this becomes the primary constraint on AI adoption.

The bottleneck is not the ability of AI to execute tasks. It is our ability to provide the context required to do them well. Quality context availability, rather than tool capability or prompting skill, is now the limiting factor for value.

The Context-First Framework solves this by shifting how we curate organisational knowledge. It relies on producing curated Context Artefacts: structured, high-leverage assets designed to be read by humans but consumed by AI.

The return on investment is not just faster execution. It is the elimination of rework, earlier issue detection, and the difference between AI that hallucinates and AI that delivers.

### The Structural Reality: Why The Experience Differs

If you view an organisation as a network graph, you understand why work feels different depending on where you sit.

Consider the contrast between a CEO and a Delivery Lead. Senior leaders often send surprisingly few emails. They dictate terms, and context flows downward from them. However, move down to the delivery teams and the structural reality shifts. These teams exist in a dense web of dependencies. They must coordinate with peers, clarify requirements, and validate work with risk and compliance functions.

They cannot simply "opt out" of this communication. They are bound by the coordination demands their role creates.

The problem is that critical knowledge is not stored in a system. It is fragmented across this web. Bottlenecks form around key individuals because they hold the context. Delivery effectively moves only as fast as these individuals can attend meetings.

Our typical response is to add more people. Yet adding nodes to a congested network only increases the number of connections and noise. This compounds the coordination tax rather than reducing it.

## The Cost of Context: A Strategy Refresh

Earlier this year, we underwent a strategy refresh. The shift was communicated via the typical mechanisms of leadership forums and high-level presentations. But when it came time to execute, we were left with a single PowerPoint slide.

As a leader, I needed to know if we were still aligned, what specifically needed to shift, and why these priorities were chosen now. To answer this, I needed the rationale, not just the bullet points.

Finding the information required to give AI the context to answer these questions was painful.

For the Group Strategy, it took ten minutes to find as information was generally available and captured in longer articles. For the Technology Strategy, I spent hours browsing over twenty intranet pages to assemble a coherent picture. For Operations, there was virtually nothing accessible.

Synthesising this scattered information took the better part of a day. Had I used the provided PowerPoint with an AI tool, the lack of rationale would have forced the AI to make assumptions or produce generic advice.

This is the context problem in practice. Critical knowledge exists, but it is fragmented. Because we lack a standard for transferring context, we default to meetings which drowns our key people in the process.

## Why AI Changes Everything

We are investing in AI to accelerate execution, such as writing code, analysing data, or drafting documents. But execution is no longer the bottleneck.

If you analyse how teams spend their time, the actual task often takes less time than gathering the context to do it right. We spend hours clarifying requirements and days waiting for answers.

If AI cannot access the context it needs, it will simply produce wrong answers faster.

### The Adoption Paradox

Much of the current excitement focuses on identifying use cases. This top-down energy is positive but often misguided. AI models are reasoning engines. They require fuel to operate, and that fuel is context. If we do not provide the infrastructure to feed them, they remain novelties rather than tools.

The path to transformation is not just building agents. It is bottom-up enablement. When you give employees the context infrastructure to make AI useful in their daily work, they will naturally identify where to apply it to customer problems.

### The Agile Documentation 'Bug'

There is a fundamental tension between modern Agile habits and AI requirements. The Agile Manifesto preference for "working software over comprehensive documentation" was a necessary correction to Waterfall. In the AI era, this mindset has become a liability.

Traditional Agile relies on tacit knowledge and conversation. We minimise documentation because we assume we can "jump on a call" to fill gaps.

This approach is fatal for AI adoption. AI cannot jump on a call. It cannot read the room during a standup. It requires explicit, structured context before the work starts.

Crucially, fixing this 'bug' does not mean returning to Waterfall. We are not advocating for static, 100-page requirements binders that lock in scope. We are advocating for living assets that capture intent and rationale. In Waterfall, documentation was a gate. In a Context-First organisation, documentation is a compass—it guides the AI and the team, but it is expected to evolve as we learn.

## The Responsibility Shift

The emergence of AI exposes that verbal communication is no longer sufficient.

This creates a new responsibility. The Context Holder must become a publisher, not just a broadcaster. It is no longer acceptable to present for an hour and leave the audience to reconstruct the rationale. The leader must produce a Context Artefact, a structured record of the "why" and "what", that allows teams to immediately leverage that context in their own AI workflows.

Without explicit guidance, AI fails on the "last mile", the 20% of the task that relies on tacit knowledge or nuance. AI forces us to make our standards explicit.

Bad Context + AI = Bad Output + Low Trust.
Good Context + AI = High Quality + High Adoption.

## The Solution: Context-First Framework

We must flip the model. Instead of using collaboration to find context, we must create context to enable collaboration.

This operating model rests on three pillars:

1. Context Cascade: The flow of structured artefacts down through the organisation.
2. Context Core: The operational hub where local knowledge moves from heads to assets.
3. Changing Patterns of Work: The shift from "docs-last" to "context-first".

### 1. Context Cascade

Thoughtfully curating long-form context artefacts that  flows down hierarchically through the organisation. Where each level inherits the context from the level above it to ensure alignment and consistency. These could simply be a word doc or pdf that replaces/supplement PowerPoint slides and dot points.

• Group Level: A living "Source of Truth" artefact containing enduring elements like Vision and Values, alongside variable elements like Quarterly Priorities and Rationale.
• Division/Domain Level: Extends the Group context with specific implications for Technology, Operations, or Retail.
• Team Level: Teams query these upstream artefacts to align their local work instantly.

Instead of leaders synthesising context manually, they inherit curated artefacts. Alignment becomes structural rather than effortless.

### 2. Context Core

The Context Core is a team’s living knowledge hub. A standing policy in context-first teams is to resolve questions in the Hub before calling a meeting.

A foundational Context Core might include:
• Vision & Strategic Pillars with rationale
• Variable Priorities: The "Why Now" rationale and OKRs.
• Decision Log: A record of what changed and why.
• Explicit Definition of Done: Turning instinct into verifiable standards.

The Format Matters: While the concept is tool-agnostic, the implementation should be machine-readable. Whether these are Markdown files in a repository, structured Wiki pages, or Notion documents, they must be text-heavy and structured (using clear headings and bullet points) so they can be easily ingested by Large Language Models. Avoid trapping this context in video recordings or unsearchable slide decks.

### 3. Changing Our Patterns of Work

This pillar redefines when we create context. We move to a "Pause and Prime" rhythm.

Pause: Before execution, take a focused pause to capture the "why" and "what" into a seed Context Artefact. This is not Waterfall planning. It is the minimal critical act of making intent explicit.

Prime: Immediately publish this seed to all stakeholders including Risk, Compliance, and Engineering.

This structure allows downstream teams to work in parallel from Day Zero. It replaces the discovery phase of endless kickoff meetings with immediate, informed action.


## How Work Changes

Adopting this model shifts the daily experience of work.

We move from Docs-last to Context-first. Critical context is captured before work starts, not after it is finished.

We move from Status Meetings to Update-don't-meet. Meetings are reserved for novel problem solving, not routine updates.

We move from Centralised Quality to Socialised Quality. Standards are verifiable in the Context Core rather than held in a manager's head.

### Where and How to Start

The best way to prove the value is to leverage a "Context-Dense Moment".

Take an existing rhythm, such as Quarterly Planning. Historically, the Quarterly Memo was a compliance burden. In a Context-First world, it is a high-leverage asset.

1. Capture: Use AI to transcribe planning sessions.
2. Synthesise: Turn that transcript into a structured Context Artefact containing Strategy, Priorities, and Rationale.
3. Publish: Make this the Context Core for the quarter.

By transforming a compliance document no one reads into a strategic asset everyone queries, you demonstrate the value loop immediately.

## Conclusion: Context as Infrastructure

The promise of AI is not just faster execution. It is a fundamental reimagining of how we coordinate. But this transformation is impossible if we do not solve the context problem.

The economics have shifted. Context is no longer administrative overhead. It is infrastructure. It is the fuel that makes AI transformative. The question is not whether you can afford to invest in context, but whether you can afford not to.
