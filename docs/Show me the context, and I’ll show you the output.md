## Becoming a Context-First Organisation

#### Why AI demands we rethink how we work. The bottleneck isn’t AI’s ability to do tasks. It’s our ability to give AI the context it needs to do them well.


---

## At a Glance

**The Adoption Plateau:** Despite the successful internal launch of ChatGPT, usage is flattening. The bottleneck is not model capability. It is the absence of structured institutional knowledge that AI systems require to deliver strategic value.

**The Context Gap:** Recent Quarterly Planning cycles have exposed a structural flaw in how CBA transfers knowledge. High-fidelity strategy is delivered verbally in Town Halls but reaches execution teams as low-fidelity notes and screenshots. No amount of prompt engineering can bridge this gap when the underlying context does not exist in machine-readable form.

**The Operating Model Shift:** To scale AI adoption, CBA must transition to a Context-First Operating Model. One that treats context not as administrative overhead, but as essential infrastructure. This requires converting tacit knowledge into structured reasoning objects that both humans and AI can consume.

**The Value at Stake:** Organisations that solve the context problem unlock the difference between AI that hallucinates generic advice and AI that delivers strategic reasoning aligned to institutional priorities.

**The Ask:** Sponsor a Context-First pilot in the next Quarterly Planning cycle. Mandate minimum context standards for participating domains. Measure the impact on AI adoption, meeting load, and alignment quality.

## 1. The AI Paradox: Capability Without Fuel

We are witnessing a paradox in enterprise AI adoption. We've deployed tools like ChatGPT. Initial enthusiasm was high. Yet recent monitoring suggests the adoption curve is beginning to flatten.

Why? It is not a lack of demand. It is not a lack of tool capability. The friction lies in the nature of our work itself.

AI functions as a reasoning engine, but reasoning requires inputs. CBA still relies heavily on tacit knowledge. Strategic context that lives in meetings, presentations, and individual minds. We effectively ask employees to memorise complex strategies and then reconstruct them perfectly for an AI system that has no memory of what was discussed in last week's Town Hall.

When context is unavailable or not provided, AI hallucinates or produces generic, low-value outputs. The bottleneck is not the AI's ability to perform the task. It is our ability to give AI the context it needs to perform it well.

> "Most organisations believe they have an AI adoption problem. In reality, they have a context problem."

## 2. The Diagnosis: Quarterly Planning as Case Study

The recent Quarterly Planning cycle provided a clear illustration of this failure.

Leadership invested three hours in Town Halls, articulating high-fidelity context. Strategic narratives. Reflections on the previous quarter. Emerging constraints. Shifts in operating context. The rationale behind upcoming priorities.

Yet the tangible output for thousands of attendees for each of these session was often a single slide and their own personal notes.

It's reasonable to assume, that following these sessions, a leaders expectation of attendees is that they take this context away and consider what this means for them and their teams.

AI would seem the perfect tool to act as a strategic partner to do such a task. 

Yet, to use ChatGPT effectively for this function, every employee would have to manually reconstruct this missing context. If done, this will have resulted in massive duplicated effort across the organisation. 

### The Strategy Refresh Experience

Earlier this year, CBA underwent a strategy refresh. When it came time to execute, teams were left with a single PowerPoint slide.

Finding the information required to give AI adequate context proved painful. For the Group Strategy, it took ten minutes. Information was generally available in longer articles. For the Technology Strategy, it required hours browsing over twenty intranet pages to assemble a coherent picture. For Operations, there was virtually nothing accessible.

Putting this scattered information together took the better part of a day. Had the provided PowerPoint been used with an AI tool directly, the lack of rationale would have forced the AI to make assumptions or produce generic advice.

This is the context problem in practice. Critical knowledge exists, but it is fragmented, unstandardised, or trapped in people's heads. Because we lack a standard for transferring context, we default to meetings. Which drowns our key people in the process.

## 3. The Structural Reality: Why Experience Differs by Role

If you view an organisation as a network graph, you understand why work feels different depending on where you sit.

Consider the contrast between a CEO and a Delivery Lead. Senior leaders often send surprisingly few emails. They dictate terms, and context flows downward from them. But move down to the delivery teams and the structural reality shifts. These teams exist in a dense web of dependencies. Coordinating with peers. Clarifying requirements. Validating with risk and compliance functions.

They cannot simply opt out of this communication. They are bound by the coordination demands their role creates. The number of connections, and therefore the coordination overhead, grows exponentially.

The problem is that critical knowledge is not stored in a system. It is fragmented across this web. Bottlenecks form around key individuals because they hold the context. Delivery moves only as fast as these individuals can attend meetings.

Our typical response is to add more people. Yet adding nodes to a congested network only increases the number of connections and noise. The birthday paradox in organisational form. This compounds the coordination tax rather than reducing it.

## 4. Why Context Becomes the Scarce Resource

Humans can infer context through tone, experience, shared history, side conversations, and tacit assumptions.

AI cannot.

AI requires explicit context. Structured inputs. Clear constraints. Well-formed rationale. Definitions of success. Without these, AI produces generic answers, incorrect assumptions, misaligned outputs, low-quality drafts, and poor recommendations.

> "The quality of AI output is now a direct function of context availability, not model capability."

This creates a fundamental economic shift. Model upgrades from vendors yield marginal benefit. Perhaps 10 to 20 percent improvement in output quality. But providing good context can yield 200 to 500 percent improvement. The leverage has moved from the technology to the fuel.

## 5. The Core Tension: Agile Habits vs AI Needs

We must address a fundamental tension between how we have been trained to work and what AI requires to function.

### The Agile Conflict

The Agile Manifesto's preference for "working software over comprehensive documentation" was a necessary correction to Waterfall methodology. However, in the age of AI, the resulting "docs-last" (or docs-never) habit has become an active impediment to progress.

Traditional Agile relies on tacit knowledge and conversation. We minimise documentation because we assume we can "set up a quick meeting" or "jump on a standup" to fill gaps. The documentation that does exist is almost always created after the work is done.

**This approach is fatal for AI adoption.**

AI cannot "set up a meeting" to clarify a requirement. It cannot read the room during a standup. It requires explicit, structured context _before_ the work starts. If the context remains trapped in your head, the AI is useless.

By clinging to the Agile habit of docs-last, we are actively blocking our ability to use these tools. Without changing this dynamic, there is a hard limit to how fast we can move. The limiting factor for speed is now simply how fast you can pass context to others to perform their part of the process.

### The Responsibility Shift

The emergence of AI exposes that verbal communication is no longer sufficient. This creates a new responsibility: **the context holder must become a publisher, not just a broadcaster.**

Consider a standard quarterly leadership call. Senior leaders speak for an hour, supported by a PowerPoint slide with bullet points. Typically _what_, not _why_. Historically, this was accepted. But today, if that leader fails to provide a detailed artefact after the session, the work grows exponentially for recipients. Every downstream team must individually attempt to reconstruct the rationale.

It is no longer acceptable to present for an hour and leave the audience to reconstruct the rationale. The leader must produce a Context Artefact. A structured record of the "why" and "what" that allows teams to immediately use that context in their own AI workflows.

> "Bad Context + AI = Bad Output + Low Trust."
> 
> "Good Context + AI = High Quality + High Adoption."

## 6. Beyond AI-Powered Knowledge Management

Across the industry, the dominant trend is to centralise documents, apply AI search, generate summaries, auto-tag content, and automate updates. Vendors promise that AI-enhanced SaaS will solve the problem.

These tools are valuable but insufficient. The distinction is critical:

> "Knowledge is not context."

Knowledge bases, even AI-enhanced ones, grow horizontally. Pages, tickets, slide decks, comments, transcripts. They become more searchable, but not more meaningful.

Context, as defined in this analysis, is different. Context is deliberately authored, multi-altitude, cascading, and designed for reasoning. From enterprise strategy down to a single feature.

AI-powered search cannot decide what context _should_ exist at each altitude. How artefacts inherit from one another. Who owns their maintenance. When they must be refreshed. How they flow into planning, delivery, risk, change, and training.

**The critical distinction:** If CBA only invests in AI-powered knowledge management, we will get better search and summarisation of the past. But we will not fix the flow of context that makes future decisions better.

> "AI-powered knowledge management makes you faster. A Context-First operating model makes you right."

## 7. The Solution: A Context-First Operating Model

To scale AI adoption, CBA must shift its operating rhythm. This is not a "tech" solution requiring new software procurement. It is a **pattern-of-work** solution.

The model rests on four interlocking pillars.

### Pillar 1: Context Artefacts

We must move beyond "documents" that passively record what happened, toward **Context Artefacts**. Structured reasoning objects.

**Function:** These capture _what_ we are doing, _why_ we are doing it, and _what constraints_ apply. In a format AI can consume.

**Example:** Following a Town Hall, a seed artefact might be a 3 to 5 page "Quarterly Context Memo" that captures the strategic bets, the rationale and trade-offs, and non-negotiables. This is not a return to 80-page requirements documents. It is a deliberate, lightweight capture of intent so that both humans and AI can move faster.

**Format:** Text-heavy and structured. Markdown or Wikis. Specifically for AI ingestion. Avoid trapping context in video recordings or unsearchable slide decks.

#### The High-Leverage Rule: The Antidote to Rot

The greatest risk to context is "rot". Outdated information that creates false alignment. We do not treat all information equally. We apply a **Survivability Test**:

> "An artefact is only created if the time it saves downstream outweighs the cost to maintain it."

- **Foundational Artefacts (Slow Layer):** Strategy, Principles, Product Visions, Core Objectives. High leverage. Persistent and reviewed cyclically. Worth the maintenance cost because they align hundreds of decisions.
    
- **Variable Artefacts (Fast Layer):** Quarterly Priorities, Reflections. Medium leverage. Tied to operating rhythm and naturally expire.
    
- **Transient Information:** Tuesday's meeting minutes. Low leverage. These are not Context Artefacts. They should not be maintained.
    

Scale does not define a Context Artefact. **Leverage does.**

### Pillar 2: The Context Cascade

Context must flow structurally, not virally. We propose a hierarchical inheritance model where local teams inherit upstream artefacts.

- **Group Level:** A living "Source of Truth" artefact containing enduring elements (Vision, Values) alongside variable elements (Quarterly Priorities, Rationale).
    
- **Division/Domain Level:** Extends the Group context with specific implications for Technology, Operations, or Retail.
    
- **Crew/Squad Level:** Teams query these upstream artefacts to align their local work instantly.
    

**The Mechanism:** When a parent artefact changes, child artefacts are alerted that their assumptions may be invalid. Alignment becomes structural rather than effortful.

**Example:** If the Group shifts a strategic bet from "acquire new customers" to "deepen share of wallet," every Domain and Squad artefact downstream can be updated and re-aligned within hours. Rather than discovered piecemeal over a quarter.

### Pillar 3: The Context Core

The Context Core is a team's living knowledge hub. A standing policy in Context-First teams: resolve questions in the Core before calling a meeting.

A foundational Context Core might include:

- Vision and Strategic Pillars with rationale
- Variable Priorities: The "Why Now" rationale and OKRs
- Decision Log: A record of what changed and why
- Explicit Definition of Done: Turning instinct into verifiable standards

### Pillar 4: The Pause and Prime Rhythm

We must shift our habits to assume human plus AI co-work from day one.

**Pause:** Before execution, take a focused pause to capture the "why" and "what" into a seed Context Artefact. This is not Waterfall planning. It is the minimal critical act of making intent explicit.

**Prime:** Immediately publish this seed to all stakeholders. Including Risk, Compliance, and Engineering.

**Implementation:** The Quarterly Planning cycle is the perfect moment to institutionalise this rhythm. Capture the strategic reasoning once, then let every squad and AI agent consume the same source. Rather than everyone rewriting it from memory.

## 8. The Value Proposition: Lowering the Barrier to Entry

The primary objection to documenting context is "it takes too much time." This view ignores how AI fundamentally changes the equation.

A Context-First model actually **lowers the barrier** to using AI by solving the "Blank Page" problem.

### The Death of the Blank Page

We can drastically reduce the time to create context by using AI as a force multiplier:

**Method A. The AI Iterate Loop:** Dump rough bullet points into an LLM. Ask it to "Structure this into a Context Artefact." Review and refine. Time: 5 minutes.

**Method B. Voice-to-Context:** Dictate your rationale and constraints while walking. Use AI to extract and format the artefact. Time: 3 minutes.

**Method C. Discussion-to-Artefact:** Have the debate. Record it. Use AI to synthesise the decision and rationale into an artefact. Time: 0 minutes. A byproduct of the meeting.

### The Usage Loop

Once context exists, it becomes the "fuel" for every downstream interaction. An employee does not have to spend hours prompting an AI with background information. They simply point the AI to the established Context Artefact.

## 9. The Economics of Context

The argument that "writing context is extra homework" is dangerously flawed.

> "Context Hoarding is a Performance Issue. Holding critical context in your head is not a sign of agility. It is a single point of failure."

"I didn't have time to write it down" is simply an admission that you have chosen to pay the **Meeting Tax** instead.

Without explicit context:

- AI adoption stalls
- Meetings multiply to transfer tacit knowledge
- Experts become bottlenecks
- Risk and compliance intervene late
- Misalignment increases
- Rework grows

This cost is already being paid. Silently, repeatedly, and at scale.

AI amplifies whatever it is given. Bad context yields bad output. No context yields generic output. Good context yields strategic, high-quality, aligned output.

**Context is no longer overhead. It is a product.**

---

## 10. Addressing Key Objections

### "This Sounds Like Waterfall 2.0"

The fundamental difference is what you are documenting and when it can change.

Waterfall documentation was about locking in decisions. Detailed specifications. Complete designs. Once written, changing them was expensive and discouraged.

Context Artefacts are about making intent explicit. The problem we are solving. Why now. What good looks like. Key constraints. They are deliberately high-level. And critically, they are designed to evolve.

**Concrete boundaries:**

- **Time-boxed:** The "Pause" for creating a seed Context Artefact should take hours, not weeks.
- **Scope-limited:** We document intent and constraints, not detailed requirements or designs.
- **Living, not locked:** The artefact updates as decisions are made, not frozen at the start.
- **Enables, not gates:** Work can start in parallel immediately after "Prime".

**The real test:** Can you change direction without rewriting documentation? In Waterfall, no. In Context-First, yes.

### "People Will Revert to Old Habits"

Cultural inertia is powerful. The only way this works is if the new way is demonstrably easier than the old way.

**Mechanisms that make the new way easier:**

- **AI does the heavy lifting:** Recording a 30-minute planning session and generating an AI summary is easier than manually writing meeting notes.
- **Context answers questions faster than meetings:** Querying the Context Core with AI (30 seconds) is faster than scheduling a meeting (days).
- **Integration into existing tools:** Context feeds into Slack, Jira, development environments. You encounter context in your workflow, not as a separate destination.
- **Visible value loop:** When teams see compliance issues caught early because risk had access to context from Day One, the value becomes concrete.

**Clear ownership:** Every Context Artefact has a single, named owner who holds the pen. Not the team collectively. One person accountable for keeping it current.

### "This Is Just Knowledge Management All Over Again"

Traditional knowledge management initiatives failed because the value exchange was broken. It was expensive to create and low-value to consume.

**What is genuinely different now:**

- **Creation cost has collapsed:** AI can draft initial context from a recorded conversation. What took three hours now takes twenty minutes.
- **Consumption value has exploded:** AI can query structured Context Artefacts and return precisely relevant information.
- **The value loop is immediate:** You update a Context Artefact, and within minutes your AI assistant gives better suggestions.
- **Context has an owner:** Clear accountability rather than everyone's job being no one's job.

Traditional knowledge management was document storage. Context-First is **context infrastructure** for AI.

### "How Is This Different from Confluence Plus AI?"

Confluence with AI search will help you find documents faster. It will summarise what exists. It will auto-tag content.

It will not tell you what context _should_ exist at each altitude. It will not create inheritance relationships between artefacts. It will not alert you when a parent constraint changes. It will not wire context into your quarterly planning rhythm.

AI-powered knowledge management optimises for _retrieval_. Context-First optimises for _reasoning_.

You need both. But one without the other leaves value on the table.

## 11. How Work Changes

A Context-First organisation experiences faster planning, earlier risk detection, higher-quality AI drafts, clearer dependencies, fewer meetings, better onboarding, more parallel work, stronger decision-making, less rework, and better alignment.

|Traditional Habit (Agile)|Context-First Practice|
|---|---|
|**Docs-last:** Documentation created after development|**Context-first:** Critical context captured before work starts|
|**Slideware alignment:** Strategic intent shared via stale slide decks|**AI-ready structured docs:** Context in living artefacts AI can query|
|**Status meetings for updates:** Teams rely on frequent meetings to sync|**Update-don't-meet:** Meetings reserved for novel issues only|
|**Tacit "Hero" Knowledge:** Success relies on individual instinct|**Explicit Shared Context:** Instinct made explicit and verifiable|
|**Centralised Quality:** Standards held by senior managers|**Socialised Quality:** Standards verifiable in the Context Cascade|

This is not documentation. This is the **operating system for AI-enabled work**.

## 12. How We Start: The Quarterly Context Pilot

We do not need a massive, six-month rollout. We can get the basics right in just one Quarterly Planning cycle by doing two things at once. Getting leaders to share better context. And getting teams to capture their own.

### The Opportunity: Quarterly Planning

The next planning cycle is the perfect time to start. Instead of just talking at people in Town Halls, we ask leaders to write down the key context _before_ planning starts.

### Top-Down: Leaders Set the Scene

Group, Division, and Domain leaders publish their context documents.

- **Content:** What we are trying to do, what is stopping us, and what is non-negotiable.
- **Format:** Clear, written text (not just slides).
- **Goal:** Give teams the "big picture" they need to make decisions.

### Bottom-Up: Teams Get Ready

At the same time, squads use the planning window to set up their own team context.

- **Content:** What the team is here for, what "done" looks like, and what they are prioritising.
- **Goal:** Create a clear guide that explains how the team works.

### Bringing It Together

By the end of planning, we connect the two:

- Teams use AI to check if their plans make sense against the leadership's goals: _"Given the new Division goals, does our plan miss anything?"_
- Leaders use AI to see what is happening across the teams: _"Summarise the top three risks identified by the Payments squads."_

### The Tool: The Quarterly Context Memo

We will use the existing Quarterly Memo but make it actually useful. Instead of a compliance form nobody reads, it becomes the place where teams write down their context so everyone (and the AI) can understand what they are doing.

---

## 13. Conclusion

The events of the past month have clarified our trajectory. We cannot "prompt engineer" our way out of a lack of strategy. AI is a multiplier. It amplifies whatever it is given. Bad context yields bad output. Good context yields strategic alignment.

We do not have an AI adoption problem. We have a **context problem**.

AI cannot operate on tacit knowledge. It cannot act on verbal context. It cannot reason from screenshots. It requires structured, explicit, cascading context.

AI capabilities will improve naturally. Models will get better at writing, analysing, and creating. But those improvements only translate to organisational value when AI has the context to apply them effectively.

The standard approach of hunting for AI use cases and rolling out solutions misses this. Bottom-up adoption starts with enablement. Give people context infrastructure. Let them experience AI becoming genuinely useful for their daily work. Watch them naturally identify opportunities to apply it more broadly.

The economics have shifted. Context is no longer administrative overhead. It is infrastructure. It is the fuel that makes AI transformative.

**The solution is clear:**

1. Build Context Artefacts
2. Establish a Context Cascade
3. Create Context Cores at team level
4. Shift to Pause and Prime Patterns of Work
5. Treat context as a first-class asset

> "In the age of AI, context is infrastructure."

The real question is not whether we can afford the time to capture it, but whether we can afford an organisation that cannot clearly articulate its own reasoning to the intelligence it seeks to employ.

**Now is the perfect moment to begin.**
