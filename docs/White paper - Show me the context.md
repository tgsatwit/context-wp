# The Context-First Organisation: Why AI Demands We Rethink How We Work

## Executive Summary

“Too many meetings. Too many emails.” How many times have you heard this?

We have a context flow problem. Critical knowledge is trapped in people’s heads, accessible only through endless meetings and emails. Unsolved, this could be a huge constraint on AI adoption and our ability to leverage AI to help us deliver value.

Why? The bottleneck isn’t AI’s ability to do tasks. It’s our ability to give AI the context it needs to do them well. Quality context availability, not execution capability, tool availability or people’s ability to prompt, is now the limiting factor for AI value.

The Context-First Framework is built on producing curated **Context Artefacts** by combining a structured approach to curating organisational context and changing our patterns of work to product it. It provides a practical pathway to solve the context flow problem, unlock experts, and build an organisation that learns and adapts at the speed of change. 

The ROI isn’t just faster execution; it’s dramatically reduced rework, earlier issue detection, and genuine AI adoption by our people.

## The Structural Reality: Why The Experience Differs

If you observe an organisation as a network graph, you begin to understand why the experience of work feels so different depending on where you sit.

Consider the experience of a CEO compared to a delivery lead. It is not uncommon to hear of senior leaders who send surprisingly few emails a day. To a team member drowning in notifications, this reality can feel impossible or disconnected. However, this is rarely about personal discipline alone of these senior; it is a structural function of the organisational graph.

At the top, context flows down as strategic direction. Leaders can often dictate the terms by which they engage.

But move down to the teams that deliver, and the structural reality shifts. These teams exist in a dense web of dependencies: coordinating with other teams, clarifying requirements, validating with risk and compliance. They cannot simply "opt out"; they must respond to the coordination demands their role creates. The number of connections, and therefore the coordination overhead, grows exponentially.

The critical knowledge isn’t in a system; it’s in people’s heads. Bottlenecks form around key people because that’s where the context is trapped. Delivery can only move as fast as their capacity allows.

Our failing response is to add more people. When we need to speed up, we add more nodes to the bottleneck, which exponentially increases the connections and noise, compounding the problem (the birthday paradox).

### Example: The Strategy Refresh

Earlier this year, we went through an organisational strategy refresh. Communicated through the typical mechanism: leadership forums, targeted sessions, presentations that gave our people the foundational understanding of the shift. When it was time to return to work and understand what this meant for our teams, we were left with a PowerPoint slide.

As a leader responsible for work, I needed to understand: Are we still aligned? What needs to shift? To do this analysis effectively, particularly with AI assistance, I needed more than bullet points. I needed the rationale. Why these priorities? Why now?

Every leader who was a recipient of this context being passed to them was then responsible for synthesising this information and mapping this to their part of the organisation. Of course, that is a leaders responsibility, but in order to use AI tools, each leader would then be responsible for curating this context to pass into it.

This information existed, but scattered across intranet sites.

For the Group strategy, it took about 10 minutes to find and pull together a two-page artefact or not just the priorities, but the rationale. For Technology’s strategy, I visited over 20 different intranet pages to assemble something comparable. Several hours of work. For Operations, I could find virtually nothing meaningful on the intranet. The rationale simply wasn’t documented anywhere accessible.

I then had to synthesise all of this with our team’s purpose and priorities. This took the better part of a day.

I could have used the PowerPoint they provided, but the quality would have been nowhere near adequate. Without the rationale, AI had to make assumptions, leading to generic analysis that missed the nuance of our strategic context.

This is the context problem in practice. Critical knowledge exists but is fragmented, unstandardised, or trapped in people’s heads. The default methods for transferring this context are meetings and emails, which is why our key people are drowning in them.

This example is at one end of the context flow spectrum, a strategic shift communicated from senior leaders to people leaders, but this pattern can be seen across the organisation for everyday work.

### Building on This: The Quarterly Planning Cycle

The strategy refresh is a periodic event, but the same pattern plays out every quarter through the planning cycle. Group leader calls. Divisional town halls. Organisation-wide town halls. Each grounded in strategy, but also reflecting on achievements from the previous quarter, examining what could have been done differently, and assessing how the current operating context shapes priorities for the quarter ahead.

These sessions are genuinely valuable. You receive the full context: the rationale, the trade-offs, the nuance. They equip you with the talking points to cascade direction to your team. The problem isn't the quality of what's communicated; it's the form.

Everything is delivered verbally, supported by a PowerPoint with dot points. When the session ends, it becomes the responsibility of every recipient to interpret what it means for their team and pass it on. If you want to answer the question "what does this mean for my role and my team?", you must document all that context yourself.

This has compounding implications:

**Exponential duplication of effort.** There are far more recipients than publishers. If a hundred leaders attend a quarterly call, and each needs to synthesise that context into a form they can use with AI, that's a hundred people doing the same translation work. The context holder does the work once; the recipients do it many times over.

**Lossy transmission and variance.** Each recipient interprets and articulates the context differently. Some capture it well. Others miss key nuances or introduce errors. Across the organisation, you end up with significant variance in how the same strategic direction is understood and applied. The further from the source, the more the signal degrades.

**A barrier to AI adoption.** Here's the critical point: to use AI tools to understand what this quarter's priorities mean for your team, you first need context in a form AI can consume. If you only have dot points from a slide and memories from a call, the barrier to using AI is that you must first write all of that context yourself. Most people won't. They'll either struggle through manually, or they'll feed AI incomplete context and get generic outputs that don't reflect the strategic reality.

This is where the responsibility shift becomes tangible. Imagine if, following those sessions, you received not just the PowerPoint but a comprehensive document capturing the detailed context: the strategic rationale, the reflections, the priorities, the "why now."

Armed with that artefact, you could immediately combine it with your own team's context—your purpose, your vision, your current work—and use AI to analyse what it means for you. The barrier disappears. Instead of spending hours reconstructing context from memory, you spend minutes getting actionable insights.

The difference is stark: without the artefact, AI adoption is gated by each individual's willingness and ability to document context. With the artefact, AI becomes immediately useful, and the quality of output is consistent because everyone is working from the same source.

## Why AI Changes Everything

We are investing in AI tools to help us accelerate. The promise is compelling: AI that can write code, analyse data, draft documents, identify risks. These capabilities will naturally continue to improve.

But the bottleneck isn’t AI’s ability to do tasks. It’s our ability to give AI the context it needs to do them well.

Think about how we actually spend time today. Writing the code, creating the analysis, drafting the document often takes less time than gathering the context needed to do it right. We spend hours in meetings clarifying requirements, days waiting for answers about constraints, weeks iterating because critical information surfaced too late.

AI capabilities for task execution will improve on their own. But without changing how we organise and share context, that improved capability hits a ceiling. If AI can’t access the context it needs, it will produce faster wrong answers.

This is the fundamental shift: context availability, not execution capability, becomes the limiting factor for AI value.

### The Adoption Paradox

Much of the excitement in AI adoption has centered on “finding use cases”: identifying specific problems where AI might help, building agents, and rolling them out. This energy is positive, but in the rush to build, non-experts have perhaps gotten a little carried away without fully understanding the fundamentals of how these tools work.

These tools are not magic; they are reasoning engines that require fuel, context, to operate effectively.

If our people can’t use AI effectively to solve their own daily work problems because they lack the context to make AI useful, how will they possibly create AI solutions that help our customers?

The path to transformative AI isn’t just top-down use case hunting. It’s bottom-up enablement: give people the context infrastructure so AI becomes genuinely useful in their own work. When they experience AI helping them deliver higher quality faster because it has the right context, they’ll naturally identify opportunities to apply that same approach to customer problems.

### The Agile Documentation 'Bug'

There is a fundamental tension between how we have been trained to work and what AI requires to function. The Agile Manifesto’s "Working software over comprehensive documentation" was a necessary correction to Waterfall, but in the age of AI, this mindset has become antithetical to progress.

Traditional Agile relies on **tacit knowledge** and **conversation**. We minimise documentation because we assume we can "set up a quick meeting" or "jump on a standup" to fill the gaps. The documentation that _does_ exist is almost always created post-hoc, after the work is done.

**This approach is fatal for AI adoption.**

AI cannot "set up a meeting" to clarify a requirement. It cannot read your mind during a standup. It requires explicit, structured context _before_ the work starts. If the context is trapped in your head, the AI is useless.

By clinging to the Agile habit of "docs last" (or docs never), we are actively blocking our ability to leverage these tools.

Without changing this dynamic, there is a hard limit to how fast we can go. The limiting factor for speed is now simply how fast you can pass context to others to perform their part of the process. Until that context is explicitly shared, the next person (or AI) cannot start, or they require a heap of meetings, emails, and multiple iterations just to gather the information needed to begin.

On the flip side, with the right context captured first, tasks that traditionally done later in delivery lifecycle, such as risk reviews, can be started earlier, as opposed to waiting until its documented (post) or being dependent on endless meetings and emails.

### The Responsibility Shift

The emergence of AI and modern tooling has further exposed the context flow problem. It highlights that verbally communicating context is no longer sufficient.

This creates a new responsibility: the holder of the context must share it in a form that allows the recipient to consume it effectively with AI tools.

Consider a standard quarterly leadership call. Senior leaders speak for an hour, supported by a PowerPoint slide with bullet points (typically what, not why). Historically, this was accepted. But today, if that leader fails to provide a detailed artefact post-session, the work grows exponentially for the recipients. Every downstream team must individually attempt to reconstruct the rationale, often documenting it imperfectly to feed their own processes. This principle extends to any team member, sharing context to one or many people for them to discharge their responsibilities / do their work.

The context holder must now be a "publisher," not just a broadcaster. Thankfully, there’s a great new tool to help them do this… AI to document the context in long form. For example, a leader can transcribe their 30-minute playback and use AI tools to tidy it up into a structured **Context Artefact**. By providing this detailed, accessible context, they enable their teams to immediately leverage it in their own AI workflows, preventing massive duplication of effort and misalignment.

In the absence of this, using the example of the strategy refresh or a quarterly leadership call, barriers to use AI are being created as the onus is on the recipients to translate what they heard as input into an AI tool. Not to mention the duplication of effort and inconsistency of input that this would inevitably lead to.

**Tacit vs Explicit Knowledge**

Without explicit guidance, AI executes 80% of the task perfectly but fails on the critical last 20% because that final mile relies on tacit knowledge. Here’s where Agile’s preference for implicit communication has become a liability. 

AI forces us to make our standards explicit. If you give AI only the ‘what’ from the PowerPoint, it will make up the why. It cannot guess your quality criteria; they must be concrete enough to verify.

This is why the economics of documentation have flipped. Before AI, writing extensive documentation was expensive and often wasteful. Now, creating structured **Context Artefacts** is cheap (thanks to AI assistance) and essential.

We need to move from unstructured "documents" (slide decks, loose wiki pages) to structured **Context Artefacts** designed for consumption. These artefacts translate tacit "hero" knowledge into the explicit standards AI needs to be reliable.

In simple terms: Bad context + AI = Bad output + Low trust. Good context + AI = High-quality output + High adoption.

## The Solution: Context-First Framework

We must change our approach. Instead of using collaboration to find context, we need to create context to enable collaboration. This new approach is built on producing, managing, and leveraging **Context Artefacts**: high-leverage, structured context documents that are readable by humans but built for AI, and are used as context seed into prompts or agents.

This new operating model is built on three pillars that describe how these artefacts are created, managed, and used:

1. **Context Cascade:** The process of distilling and flowing Context Artefacts down through the organisation.
2. **Context Core:** The practice of maintaining high-leverage Context Artefacts at a local level, moving knowledge from people’s heads into these shared, queryable assets.
3. **Changing Our Patterns of Work:** The new patterns of work that are oriented around the creation, distribution and use of Context Artefacts.

### Context Cascade

Context Cascade establishes a hierarchy of shared context that flows throughout the organisation. Each level inherits context from the levels higher.

**What Context Cascade would enable in the strategy refresh example:**

Strategy Forums, Town Halls and Leadership calls would of course remain the cornerstone, but supplementing these and the presentations, structured **Context Artefacts** would be distributed:

- **Group level:** This might be one or many artefacts serving as the primary source of truth. It is a living document that evolves quarter-to-quarter, structured into two layers:
    
    - **The Fixed Components:** Enduring elements like Strategy, Vision, Values, and Leadership Principles.
    - **The Variable Components:** The specific priorities for the upcoming quarter and reflections on the last. This explicitly captures the narrative often lost in leadership calls, the rationale, the "why now," and the nuance, so it can be reused. 
    
    As this top level updates, it generates a cascade, ensuring that this fresh context flows down and the organisation remains aligned. 
    
    It’s then the document owner’s  responsibility to keep this updated as critical context that is leveraged across the organisation.
    
- **Division and Domain level:** Similar structure, but more detail for that division (Tech, Operations, Retail, Business Banking, Institutional etc) and domain (the next level down) showing how they align to and extend the Group context.
    
- **Team level:** Teams can then query these documents with AI to understand implications for their specific work.

Instead of leaders spending a day manually hunting and synthesising context, they receive curated artefacts they can immediately use. The rationale is explicit. The alignment is clear. AI can help analyse implications because it has the full context, not just bullet points.

**How it works:**

- **Shared context flows down:** The organisation’s strategy, rationale, priorities, and guardrails cascade downward (as Context Artefacts) from the organisation to divisions to teams.
- **Local context extends and refines:** Each team or initiative extends the context locally by adding feature-specific details to their own Context Artefacts: intended outcomes, acceptance criteria, evidence required.
- **Consistency consolidates upward:** Because every team’s context is structured, insights and updates can roll back up the chain with minimal effort. Quarterly context memos can be amalgamated upward, patterns identified across teams, and strategic insights surfaced without manual aggregation.

This cascade approach minimises duplication and drift. Teams aren’t constantly rehashing the “why” and key constraints. The result is clarity without meetings.

### Context Core

Thinking of the organisation as a graph, at each ‘node’ of the cascade, context needs to be made operational and accessible. The Context Core is that operational hub: a team’s knowledge hub for its **Context Artefacts**, serving as a living, queryable repository.

Ideally, you should think about starting with your highest leverage artifacts at the core as foundational and build out knowledge from there, I.e. the intent here is not to try to document everything at once; but start with the documents that will be referenced most frequently by the most people and build out context from the core, foundational context.

A foundational set of **Context Artefacts** for a team might contain:
- **Vision/Purpose:** The fundamental purpose, problem, and intended outcomes for a domain, team or product; the core strategic pillars that the work aligns with; the long-term priorities, governing policies, brand guidelines, and risk guardrails.
- **Annual/Quarterly Priorities (The "Variable"):** The specific "why-now" rationale, key OKRs for the period, and success measures.
- **Reflections / Decision Log:** A running log of key decisions, learnings from past cycles, and a "what changed" log to keep the artefact alive.
- **Dependencies:** Key dependencies, interfaces, and owners (teams or systems).
- **Explicit Definition of Done:** What “done” looks like. This is where “instinct” becomes a concrete, verifiable standard.

Then from this, these artefacts could then review backlogs and complete or review prioritisation to ensure alignment; they could be used as a basis for communication to the team or stakeholders; they could be used to help build context for new or changes to existing products or features - this new context artefact could then in turn be used to breakdown the build of this new feature and ensure each user story is complete, accurate and aligned with the upstream context. 

Critically, the Context Core is where work happens first. A standing policy in context-first teams is: “resolve it in the hub before calling a meeting.” This habit ensures that the Context Artefacts stay complete and current, and it dramatically reduces the need for repetitive status meetings and probability of adhoc meetings to provide updates or drip feed information.

A lot of this information exists today, but is scattered, unstructured, trapped in email chains, in meeting transcripts, can be duplicated in various sources which make RAG and Organisational Knowledge features prone to error. The intent is to arrest that, focus on building out structured and specifically curated artefacts that are accessible and create leverage. It will require work to maintain, but the cost of not doing it is more meetings, emails and low adoption of AI is it won’t be able to generate the quality output that we need.

### Changing Our Patterns of Work

This pillar is about when and how you produce **Context Artefacts**. It represents the shift from “docs-last” to context-first execution.

The new pattern has two main steps: **Pause** and **Prime**:

- **Pause:** Take a short, focused pause before jumping into building. Use this time to write down the “why,” the “what,” and the guiding principles _into an initial Context Artefact_. This is not waterfall planning; it is the minimal critical act of making your intent explicit. This step prevents the common trap of automating an existing, inefficient process rather than pausing to reimagine the work itself. It’s where the context holder discharges their responsibility of capturing context.
- **Prime:** Immediately publish the seed **Context Artefact** to all stakeholders and systems. So all that are involved in the process of delivering this strategy, product or feature (e.g. Risk, Compliance, Change, and Engineering) all get this context from day zero.

By focusing on 'Pause and Prime,' we create a better mechanism to share context upfront. This structured sharing is what _allows_ teams to work in parallel, replacing the need for endless kickoff meetings and email chains just to start work. It shifts the coordination tax from a reactive burden to a proactive, low-friction setup.

By focussing on this in context dense moments like quarterly planning, with thoughtfully designed artefacts, we show people the criticality and power of the right context when using AI. They can then apply these principles at a local 



## The Business Case: Why Context is Worth the Investment

Consider the simple comparison of improving AI itself versus improving context. Upgrading your AI model (say, moving from one generation to the next) might net you a 10-20% gain in output quality or speed. In contrast, giving that same AI high-quality, relevant context (via a **Context Artefact**) can yield performance improvements in the hundreds of percent. AI amplifies whatever context you give it, good or bad.

Let’s revisit the old versus new documentation trade-off:

|Approach|Relative Upfront Effort|Delivery Speed Outcome|Estimated ROI|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Waterfall (pre-Agile)** - Heavily document upfront|Very High (extensive specs, designs, docs)|Negligible benefit (docs often unused)|**Negative ROI** (wasted effort)|
|**Agile** - Minimal documentation, ad-hoc context|Minimal (rely on code & conversation)|~2× faster than Waterfall (less overhead)|**~100% ROI** (time saved equals time not spent on docs)|
|**Context-First (Agile x AI)** - Seed context as infrastructure|Low-Medium (structured Context Artefacts)|~10× faster delivery with AI assistance|**Exponential ROI** (massive net gain)|

### Expected Benefits

The returns from a context-first approach manifest across multiple dimensions:

**Eliminating Context-Gathering Overhead:**

Look at how your teams actually spend their time. Writing code, creating analysis, drafting proposals often takes a fraction of the time compared to:

- Attending meetings to understand requirements
- Waiting for responses from key people
- Iterating through multiple rounds because critical constraints surfaced late
- Redoing work because assumptions were wrong

When the right context is available upfront (as a **Context Artefact**), teams can start work with clarity rather than assumptions, identify issues before investing significant effort, and deliver quality outcomes in fewer iterations.

**Cycle Time Improvements:** When teams have clear, upfront context, they eliminate the costly cycles of late-stage discovery and rework. Validation activities that currently happen sequentially at the end could happen in parallel from the beginning.

**Early Issue Detection:** Problems that today surface weeks into development (compliance gaps, architectural misalignments, security concerns) could be caught before significant work is invested. The cost differential between catching an issue in the design phase versus post-implementation is orders of magnitude.

**Meeting and Coordination Overhead:** An “update-don’t-meet” culture, where context hubs (holding **Context Artefacts**) replace status meetings, could dramatically reduce coordination time. Teams spending 20-30% of their time in meetings would redirect much of that towards value creation instead.

**Organisational Learning:** Each initiative’s context becomes part of a growing knowledge graph. New projects don’t start from zero; they’re informed by cascaded context and past learnings. This creates compounding returns: the more you invest in context infrastructure, the faster and smarter your organisation becomes.

**Employee Experience:** Developers waiting less for answers. Risk and compliance professionals shifting from “roadblocks” to value-adding partners. New hires ramping faster because context isn’t a treasure hunt. Work feeling more proactive than reactive.

## How Work Changes

Adopting a context-first operating model fundamentally changes how people work day-to-day:

|Traditional Habit (Agile)|Context-First Practice (Agile x AI)|
|---|---|
|**Docs-last:** Documentation (if any) is created after development, mainly for compliance or handover|**Context-first:** Critical context is written _as a Context Artefact_ before work starts, providing guidance from day one|
|**“Slideware” alignment:** Strategic intent shared via slide decks that quickly go stale|**AI-ready structured docs:** Context captured in structured, living **Context Artefacts** that AI agents and team members can query in seconds|
|**Status meetings for updates:** Teams rely on frequent meetings to share updates and sync up|**Update-don’t-meet:** Teams post updates in the context hub continuously. Meetings reserved only for novel issues|
|**Tacit ‘Hero’ Knowledge:** Success relies on individual instinct and “find and seek” heroics|**Explicit Shared Context:** The instinct for “good work” is made explicit and verifiable in the Context Core|
|**“Centralised Quality”:** The “instinct for quality” is held by a few senior managers|**“Socialised Quality”:** The standard for “quality” is socialised via the Context Cascade|

These changes create a work environment that can feel very different. Initially, teams might worry that writing things down early sounds like “doing waterfall.” But in practice, it’s the opposite: instead of big upfront specs that lock in scope, context-first produces small upfront context (in **Context Artefacts**) that unlocks parallel work.

Another notable change is the speed and confidence in decision-making. In the “before” state, decisions often get revisited because new information comes to light late. In the “after” state, because context is readily available and kept current, decisions are made with a fuller picture and tend to stick.

Perhaps the most profound shift is in organisational learning and agility. In a context-first organisation, each project’s context core and outcomes become part of the institutional knowledge graph. The before/after isn’t just faster versus slower; it’s learning versus static. A context-poor organisation forgets and repeats mistakes; a context-rich organisation remembers and adapts.

## Where and How to Start

The immediate value demonstration is simple: take a strategic document (quarterly priorities, team vision and strategy, product overview) and include it in your AI prompts. Ask AI to draft something, review something, or answer a question with that context attached. Then try without it.

The difference is immediate and visceral. Without context, AI gives you generic corporate-speak that requires extensive rework. With context, it gives you something aligned, specific, and much closer to what you actually need.

This simple experiment demonstrates the value of context better than any theoretical argument. When people experience firsthand how much better AI works with proper context, the abstract becomes concrete.

### What Actually Belongs in Context Core

Not everything should be documented. The key is understanding the relationship between a document’s leverage (how many times it’s reused as seed context) and the structure it requires. This is the logic of **Context Artefacts**.

**The leverage-structure principle:** Structure and maintenance overhead should be proportional to leverage:

**Tier 1 - Organisational Strategic Context (Highest Leverage):**

- Examples: Annual strategy, quarterly OKRs, organisational context memo
- Reuse: Seeds context for hundreds of initiatives, thousands of people
- Structure: Highly structured with strict schema
- Why: 1% improvement in clarity multiplies across the entire organisation
    

**Tier 2 - Domain/Team Context Cores (High Leverage):**

- Examples: Quarterly team context memos, key architectural decisions
- Reuse: Seeds context for multiple projects, dozens of people
- Structure: Structured with consistent sections
- Why: The operational hubs that enable parallel work
    

**Tier 3 - Initiative/Project Context (Medium Leverage):**

- Examples: Feature specifications, major design decisions
- Reuse: Specific to one initiative
- Structure: Light structure around key sections

**Tier 4 - Tactical Artefacts (Low Leverage):**

- Examples: Bug tickets, meeting notes, implementation details
- Reuse: Consumed once or very few times
- Structure: Minimal, whatever works

**The key distinction: Is this document used to seed context for subsequent work, or is it the output of that work?**

**Context Artefacts** are primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 documents. Total footprint: approximately 15-25 documents organisation-wide. Everything else lives wherever it naturally lives.

### The Guiding Principle: Leverage Context-Dense Moments

The key to making this practical is to identify context-dense moments: events and ceremonies where strategic thinking, decisions, and direction are already being created and shared.

At the organisational level, these moments are already built into our rhythms:

- **Annual planning:** Where long-term strategy and vision are set
- **Quarterly big room planning:** Where strategic priorities and OKRs cascade
- **Town halls and leadership briefings:** Where direction and rationale are communicated

These moments already exist. The opportunity is to capture the output as structured, persistent **Context Artefacts** that can be reused and queried, rather than letting it evaporate once the meeting ends.

### A Concrete Starting Point: The Quarterly Context Memo

There’s already a quarterly memo that delivery domains and teams complete. This document historically had a stigma as a burden. It took significant time to create and was perceived as low-leverage: produced for compliance, then rarely referenced.

But the economics have now flipped. This quarterly context memo should be restored and enhanced as a key **Context Artefact** for three compelling reasons:

1. **It’s now high-leverage in all directions:** With standardised structure, these memos become queryable assets that enable synthesis upward, sideways, and downward.
2. **Creation overhead is dramatically reduced:** Curated context cascaded down from strategic planning, combined with AI assistance, means the memo can be assembled rather than authored from scratch.
3. **It becomes the living Context Core:** Rather than a point-in-time status report, the quarterly memo becomes the maintained hub that gets continuously updated.
    

**Why start here despite its stigma?**

- **It already exists:** No new process to introduce, just transformation of an existing one.
- **It’s already structured:** Has sections, owners, cadence.
- **Low risk, high learning:** If this transformation fails, you’ve only improved one existing document. If it succeeds, you’ve proven the model and can expand.

The transformation is from “compliance document no one reads” to “strategic **Context Artefact** everyone queries.”

### Building a Self-Sustaining Context Engine

The final step is making context creation systematic rather than episodic by embedding it into existing workflows:

- **Quarterly planning sessions:** AI transcribes and summarises the session, pulling out key decisions, priorities, and rationale. This becomes the seed for the quarterly **Context Artefact** (memo).
    
- **Product design sessions:** Key decisions, assumptions, and definitions are captured and fed directly into the Context Core.
    
- **Showcases and retrospectives:** AI-generated summaries of feedback, outcomes, and learnings automatically update the relevant **Context Artefact**.
    
- **Performance forums:** Key decisions on risk, resourcing, or trade-offs become queryable assets (or updates to existing ones).
    

The pattern is consistent: leverage context-dense moments that already exist, use AI to reduce the friction of capture and structure, and make the output persistent and queryable.

By making context creation a natural byproduct of work rather than additional overhead, we transform ceremonies from simple meetings into powerful engines for creating, refining, and refreshing context.

## Addressing Key Objections

### “This Sounds Like Waterfall 2.0”

The fundamental difference is what you’re documenting and when it can change.

Waterfall documentation was about locking in decisions: detailed specifications, complete designs. Once written, changing them was expensive and discouraged.

**Context Artefacts** are about making intent explicit: the problem we’re solving, why now, what good looks like, key constraints. It’s deliberately high-level. And critically, it’s designed to evolve. The Context Core has a “What Changed” log precisely because we expect it to change as we learn.

**Concrete boundaries:**

- **Time-boxed:** The “Pause” for creating a seed **Context Artefact** should take hours, not weeks.
    
- **Scope-limited:** We’re documenting intent and constraints, not detailed requirements or designs.
    
- **Living, not locked:** The **Context Artefact** gets updated as decisions are made, not frozen at the start.
    
- **Enables, not gates:** Work can start in parallel immediately after “Prime”.
    

The real test: Can you change direction without rewriting documentation? In waterfall, no. In context-first, yes.

### “Your People Will Just Revert to Old Habits”

This is the hardest problem. Cultural inertia is powerful. The only way this works is if the new way is demonstrably easier than the old way.

**Mechanisms that make the new way easier:**

- **AI does the transcription work:** Recording a 30-minute planning session and getting an AI-generated summary (the seed of a **Context Artefact**) is easier than manually writing meeting notes.
    
- **Context answers questions faster than meetings do:** Querying the Context Core with AI (30 seconds) is faster than scheduling a meeting (waiting days).
    
- **Integration into existing tools:** Context feeds into Slack, Jira, development environments. You encounter context in your workflow, not as a separate destination.
    
- **Visible value loop:** When teams see compliance issues caught early because risk had access to context from day one, the value becomes concrete and personal.
    

**Clear ownership:** Every **Context Artefact** in the Context Core has a single, named owner who holds the pen. Not the team collectively, but one person accountable for keeping it current.

### “This Is Just Knowledge Management All Over Again”

Traditional knowledge management initiatives failed because the value exchange was broken. It was expensive to create and low-value to consume.

**What’s genuinely different now:**

- **Creation cost has collapsed:** AI can draft initial context from a recorded conversation. What took 3 hours now takes 20 minutes.
    
- **Consumption value has exploded:** AI can query structured **Context Artefacts** and return precisely relevant information.
    
- **The value loop is immediate:** You update a **Context Artefact**, and within minutes your AI assistant is giving better suggestions.
    
- **Context has an owner:** Clear accountability rather than everyone’s job being no one’s job.
    
- **AI capabilities improve regardless:** Better models only translate to organisational value when AI has context to apply those capabilities effectively.
    

Traditional knowledge management was document storage. Context-first is **context infrastructure** for AI, built from **Context Artefacts**. When your AI tools work dramatically better with context, the incentive structure fundamentally shifts.

### “This Will Be A Maintenance Nightmare”

This is a valid concern. We have all seen wiki pages that go to die.

But we must accept a hard truth: **maintenance is a new core responsibility.**

If you hold the context, you must maintain the artefact. This is not "extra" work; it is the _essential_ work required to operate efficiently. Without a maintained artefact, the probability increases that you will have to transfer this information repeatedly via emails or meetings.

**The trade-off is clear:** Spend 15 minutes updating a Context Artefact once, or spend hours in repetitive meetings explaining the same context to different people.

Furthermore, if we don't maintain explicit context, we force the organisation to rely on:

1. **Lossy human transfer:** Someone else trying to document what you said in a meeting.
    
2. **Complex, fragile technical solutions:** Trying to build complex RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems to find needles in haystacks of stale, unstructured data.
    

**Leverage, not Overhead:** That said, we must be vigilant. The goal is leverage, not administration. We must monitor the frequency and content of these updates. If a document is updated weekly but rarely queried, it is overhead. If it is updated monthly and seeds hundreds of AI interactions, it is high-leverage infrastructure.

## Conclusion: Context as the New Operating System

The promise of AI isn’t just about faster execution; it’s about fundamentally reimagining how organisations work. But that transformation is impossible without first solving the context problem.

AI capabilities will improve naturally. Models will get better at writing, analysing, and creating. But those improvements only translate to organisational value when AI has the context to apply them effectively.

The standard approach (hunting for AI use cases and rolling out solutions) misses this. Bottom-up adoption starts with enablement: give people context infrastructure (a library of **Context Artefacts**), let them experience AI becoming genuinely useful for their daily work, and watch them naturally identify opportunities to apply it more broadly.

The Context-First Framework provides a practical pathway to break free from the coordination tax, unlock your key experts, and build an organisation that learns and adapts at the speed of change.

The economics have shifted. Context is no longer overhead; it’s infrastructure. It’s the fuel that makes AI transformative. The question isn’t whether to invest in context; it’s whether you can afford not to.
