1. Overall vibe
	•	Mood: Futuristic, precise, calm. Think “enterprise AI control room”.
	•	Lighting feel: Single, cool light source (glow or gradient) around the focal point.
	•	Complexity: Minimal UI + one clear idea per frame.

⸻

2. Layout & composition 
	•	Composition patterns:
	1.	Title slides (“Artificial Intelligence”, “Deterministic Action”, “Precision”): word centered horizontally, slightly above the true center; subtle graphic under or behind the word (line, trident, blur).
	2.	Galaxy / dots slide: focal dot in the center; dots arranged on a fairly regular grid.
	3.	Flowchart slides: tree or graph in the center; big margins so nothing touches the edges.

Aim for a single obvious focal point per frame.

3. Color system

Core palette
	•	Primary cyan: #23D4FF – highlights, arrows, key text.
	•	Deep teal: #0080A8 – card fills, secondary accents.
	•	Electric blue: #1A8BFF – emphasized letters, dots.
	•	Soft blue-grey: #A9C4D9 – secondary/dimmed text.
	•	White: #FFFFFF – tiny central highlights only.

Usage rules
	•	Cards, chips, UI blocks:
	•	Dark teal/blue fill (#04121B–#071C25).
	•	1 px cyan border at ~40–60% opacity.
	•	Very soft outer glow in cyan/teal.
	•	Text:
	•	Main words use a horizontal gradient: dark teal → bright cyan → slightly darker blue.
	•	Supporting text in soft blue-grey.

⸻

4. Typography
	•	Font family: clean sans serif (e.g. SF Pro, Inter, Poppins, Manrope).
	•	Weights:
	•	Titles: SemiBold/Bold.
	•	Body: Regular/Medium.
	•	Case: Title Case, not all caps.
	•	Letter-spacing: Slightly loose on titles (+2 to +4).

Title look
	•	Size: roughly 8–12% of canvas height.
	•	Gradient: left→right from deep teal to bright cyan, maybe back to a darker blue at the end of the word.

⸻

5. Glows, gradients & atmosphere (around objects)
	•	Radial glow behind focal elements:
	•	Inner: near white or bright cyan at 70–80% opacity.
	•	Middle: cyan/teal.
	•	Outer: fade out completely.
	•	Heavy blur so it looks like soft light, not a harsh circle.
	•	Line glows:
	•	1–2 px stroke in cyan or teal.
	•	Slight outer glow or duplicated blurred copy.
	•	Rounded end caps and smooth curves.

⸻

6. Cards, flows & UI blocks

Card style
	•	Shape: Rounded rectangle, 16–24 px radius.
	•	Fill: Dark teal/blue gradient
(e.g. top #061623 → bottom #031017).
	•	Border: 1 px cyan at 40–60% opacity.
	•	Effects: Soft outer glow; optional subtle inner shadow near the top.
	•	Icons: Simple outline icons on the left in thin cyan stroke.

Flowchart layout
	•	Hierarchy: Large block at top → 2–3 mid-level blocks → smaller leaf nodes.
	•	Spacing: Consistent vertical gaps between rows; consistent horizontal gaps between siblings.
	•	Connectors:
	•	Curved lines with rounded corners.
	•	Optional small pill labels for states (“Success”, “Failure”).

⸻

7. Dots & particle fields
	•	Grid: Dots arranged in neat rows/diagonals, not random scatter.
	•	Dot style:
	•	Radius 4–6 px.
	•	Colors sampled from cyan, electric blue, light blue-grey.
	•	Central dot 1.5–2× larger with a stronger glow.
	•	Can be used as a foreground or mid-ground “field” behind other elements.

⸻

8. Signature motifs to reuse
	•	Thin horizontal line with a minimal arrow under titles.
	•	Branching trident line under words like “Deterministic Action”.
	•	Left-to-right flow: many elements (arrows, lines) travel to the right.
	•	Central emphasis: glowing word or node in the visual center.
